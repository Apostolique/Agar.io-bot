# Agar.io-bot
The aim of the project is to create a bot that can play Agar.io

The full coding process is streamed live on http://www.twitch.tv/apostolique

Make sure to install both bot.user.js and launcher.user.js. If you don't mind having the code auto update itself though, you can simply get the loader.user.js without the other two.

#Honorable mention
There are other people working on bots, you can check the forks, as well as GamerLio's Github which uses genetic algorithms: https://github.com/leomwu/agario-bot

If you start working on a bot, make sure to start an issue and tell me about it so that I can add it to the bot list on

#Troubleshooting

If the bot doesn't spawn, it's possible that your adblocker is causing the issue. Try disabling it.
