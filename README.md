# Agar.io-bot

*FOR EVERYONE WHO KEEPS SENDING THE ISSUES TO THIS BOT, PLEASE READ [ISSUE 616](https://github.com/Apostolique/Agar.io-bot/issues/616) FOR THE REASONS AS TO WHY APOSTOLIQUE HAS STOPPED WORKING ON THIS BOT!!! (~ Drflash55)*

The aim of the project is to create a bot that can play Agar.io

The full coding process is streamed live on http://www.twitch.tv/apostolique

Make sure to install both bot.user.js and launcher.user.js. If you don't mind having the code auto update itself though, you can simply get the loader.user.js without the other two.
