# Agar.io-bot-explosive
A troll Agar.io bot that likes exploding foes.

It starts just like [Agar.io-bot](https://github.com/Apostolique/Agar.io-bot).
After obtaining some mass, it stands still on top of the nearest virus, hiding
it. When an attacker comes close enough, the bot moves away in the last second,
leaving the virus to be eaten and to explode the bigger cell.

Try it out. It's a lot of fun.
